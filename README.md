# pawn  
**3D puzzle game with a minimalist chess-inspired aesthetic.**

Solve spatial challenges by redirecting energy between different piece types — Emitters, Receivers, Routers, and Pawns — to open doors and progress through increasingly complex levels.  
Built in Unity with C#, physics-based interactions, and modular level design.
